            <a href="./family-tree.html?family=6">Walter and Emma West</a> had nine
            children, six of them were boys, three of them were very successful
            on the rugby field. Herbert was six years older than 
            <a href="#tom-west">Thomas</a>, and
            eighteen years older than Reginald. All the boys played at the same
            position, scrum-half, but Tom also played at outside-half (alongside
            Herbert in a few first team games for Bath) and, for the major part
            of his career, at wing three-quarter. Herbert sustained an eye
            injury, which probably limited his career, but <a href="#tom-west">Thomas</a> 
            played ninety first team games for Bath Football Club, including a 
            season as captain of the club. </p>
            <p>Herbert also played for a team from his workplace (Stothert &amp; Pitt).</p>

            <p> The next generation, grandsons of
            Walter and Emma, were also involved in the local rugby clubs. 
            Herbert's son Cyril (Bud) West 
            was a very successful full-back, though his playing
            career for Bath was interrupted by military service in the second
            world war. Buds cousins Arthur and Edward also played for the club
            as did in-laws Charles (Joe) Kent, who had been at school with Bud, 
            and Ken Sherriff, who married Phyllis.</p>

            <p>
                Until 1995, rugby union was an exclusively amateur game, so that
                players for local teams would be men living locally to the clubs
                and, most often, men who had learned the game together at local
                schools. This made the sport, and its clubs, a particularly strong
                element of many local communities.

          <h2>Tom West</h2>
          <p>Tom started playing for the Bath Football Club first XV in 1903 when he was twenty years old. He was an extremely fast runner, 
            having ‘won several prizes on the running track’. At that time the fortunes of the Bath team were patchy, they were often unable 
            to field a full team. Many players would come to a Saturday match from working that morning and for away games they would rely 
            on public transport, match reports show that players were delayed by missed trains on several occasions. However, it is clear 
            from these reports that Tom was an outstanding player, playing half-back and three-quarter positions.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of the 1906/07 season he was working in Gloucester and turned out for the local side. The report in the 
            local newspaper of his first game read:
            <blockquote cite=”https://d2eq6t2r9q1quu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/19070330-Glos.-v-Percy-Park-Bream-v-Glos.-A.pdf”>
          West. the ex-Bath three-quarter (who is working in Gloucester) made a highly satisfactory debut in the City ranks. Such a game was 
          not a severe test, but West showed pace and cleverness in attack, and had the distinction of scoring four tries.

          <p>He finished that season at Gloucester but returned to the Bath club the following season and was made captain. Results for that 
            season were disappointing and then, at the start of the 1908/09 season he played just three games before moving to Lancashire to play 
            for the very successful <a href="https://rochdalerlheritage.blogspot.com/p/page-5.html">Rochdale Hornets</a> club.</p>
          <p>Rochdale Hornets was a founding member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rugby_league#:~:text=Northern%Rugby%Football%Union">
            Northern Rugby Union</a> (predecessor of the Rugby League), formed only thirteen years previously. 
            The Northern Union allowed payments to players for time missed from work, meaning that clubs could consistantly achieve good results, 
            and that players like Tom could take their sport more seriously.</p></article>

          <p>The following is a quote from 'Bath in the Great War (Your Towns and Cities in the Great War)'</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>On Saturday 9 October [1915], the Bath Chronicle announced that Tom West, a well-known Bath rugby footballer, 
            had died in action. His parents, Mr and Mrs Walter West of 17 Stuart Place, Twerton, received news on the previous Saturday night that 
            he had been killed in action on Wednesday 29 September.</p><p> Rifleman Tom West had served with ‘A’ Company of the 10th Battalion King’s Royal 
            Rifle Corps. The officer who wrote to tell his parents of his death said that he died instantaneously and remarked: <q>He was a good soldier, 
            a kind friend, faithful in his duty and will be missed by all.</q></p> 
            <p>Enclosed with the note was a letter that Rifleman West had written to his mother but had not lived long enough to post. It began with 
            the message: <q>I may not have the opportunity of writing to you for a little while, so you must not worry if you don’t hear from me. 
            I shall be quite all right. We are keeping in good condition.</q></p><p> Tom West first played rugby for the Oldfield Park Club before joining the 
            Bath XV. <b>. . .</b>
            West also made several appearances for Somerset. But in 1908, he forsook amateur rugby for the Northern Union, being 
            secured by Rochdale Hornets. With them he played finely and assisted in winning the Northern Union Cup for his team.</p> He held a good position 
            in the Corporation Electricity Works at Rochdale. This he threw up, and also his football, to join the Army last autumn, when he enlisted in 
            the Rifle Corps. <p>He was in Bath at Christmas on leave and went to the front with his regiment only a short time ago. When at Aldershot, 
            he met on the parade ground an old Bath football and running pal who had also enlisted in the same battalion. This was Bert Lewis, formerly 
            captain of the Walcot rugby team and afterwards, a three-quarter for Bath. <b>. . .</b> It was a delightful surprise to the men to find 
            themselves comrades and they had been together ever since. Lewis was at Tom’s 
            side when he was struck down by a German bullet and has written home to tell of West’s glorious death.</p>
